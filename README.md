* Identify characteristics of clients who have difficulty in repaying the loans.
* Implement machine learning algorithms to predict client’s repayment abilities.

**Actions:**
* Perform data cleaning, and visualization for business insights.
* Build a models with machine learning algorithms.
* Predict client's repayment abilities on application data test with best machine learning model.
* Provide recommendations for company to increase their clients succeed in applying for loans.
